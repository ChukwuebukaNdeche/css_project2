                Nikola Tesla, a name that may not be as widely recognised as some of his contemporaries like
                <u>Thamos Edison</u>, yet his contributions to the fields of electricity, magnetism, and engineering
                have left an indelible mark on the modern world. Tesla's contributions to science and technology
                are nothing short of extraodinary. In this article, we will delve into the life and work of this 
                enigmatic inventor, exploring the genius behind <em>alternating current(AC) electricity, wireless communication</em>
                and a myriad of inventions that have shaped our modern world.

        <h3>The Early Life of Nikola Tesla</h3>
        <p>
            Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in the town of smiljan, which is now part of Croatia but was once part of the 
            Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest, while his mother, despite her lack of formal education, 
            worked with machinery and was known for her incredible memory. At a young age Tesla immersed himself in his
            father's library. He went to school like most kids and studied <u>German, math and religon</u>. During high school
            , Nikola had a physics teacher who showed his class the power of electricity. When Nikola saw it he was amazed and 
            wanted to learn more. Training for an <u>engineering</u> career, he attented the  <u>Technical University at Grazz,
            Ausria</u>, and <u>University of Prague.</u>

        <h3>Inventions and Discoveries</h3>
        <p>
            At graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a generator and, when reversed, became an <u>elctric motor</u> and he concieved a way
            to use <u>alternating current</u> to advantage. Later, at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the <u>rotating magnetic field</u>
            and developed plan for an <u>induction motor</u> that would become his first step toward the successfull utilization of 
            <u>alternating current.</u> In 1882, Tesla went to work in paris for the Continental Edison Company, and while on assignment
            to Stassburg in 1883, he constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor. Tesla sailed to America in 1884 where he found employment
            with <u>Thomas Edison</u>, but the two inventors were far apart in background and methods, and their seperation was inevitable.
            Tesla soon established his own laboratory, where his inventive mind could be given free rein. He experimented with shadowgraphs similar to 
            those that were to be later used by <u>Wilhelm Rontgen</u> when he discovered x-ray in 1895. Tesla's countless experiments included work on a 
            Carbon button lamp, on the power of electrical resonance, and on various type of lighting. In order to allay fears of alternating currents, Tesla gave 
            exhibitions in his laboratory in which he lit lamps by allowing electricity to flow through his body. He was often invited to lecture at home and abroad. 
            The <u>Tesla coil</u>, which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment. 
            That year also marked the date of Tesla's U.S. citizenship.

        <h3>Nikola Tesla's Death</h3>
        <p>
            Just before his death, he was working on some form of teleforce weapon. The famous <u>Death Ray</u>. He seemed
            obsessed with this idea, and on his eighty-fourth birthday, he announced he was ready to unveil his idea to the 
            U.S. Government. He believed it could be used to build an invisible Chinese Wall of defense nationwide.
            Tesla died of heart failure, a forgotten man, on January 7th, 1943, the Orthodox christmas day of that year with
            significant debts.His funeral was conducted in New York, and his body was cremated.

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <p>
            Tesla's inventions and discoveries have had a profound impact on the modern world, and predicted the development of hundreds
            of technologies that play big part in our daily lives. From alternating current(AC) power systems to wireless commmunication 
            and remote control,even the elctric car built by <u>Elon Musk</u> was named after Tesla. His contributions have shaped the fabric 
            of our technological society.
